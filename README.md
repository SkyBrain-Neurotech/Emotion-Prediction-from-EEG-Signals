SNET AI Service

This AI-powered EEG analysis service processes uploaded EEG data to assess relaxation levels by comparing baseline and activity session brainwave patterns. Users record EEG sessions, upload the data, and receive AI-driven insights on how their relaxation state changes between resting and active conditions.

How It Works

1. Record EEG Data – Use a compatible EEG wearable to collect brainwave data during a baseline (resting) session and an activity session.
2. Upload EEG Files – Submit your recorded EEG sessions
3. AI Analysis – The system processes EEG signals to assess relaxation levels and compare the baseline state with the activity session.
4. Receive Insights – Get a detailed report showing how relaxation levels changed between the two sessions.

This service is designed to help users understand how their brain responds to different conditions by analyzing relaxation trends across:

Baseline State – EEG signals recorded in a relaxed, resting condition.
Activity Session – EEG signals recorded during a tas
